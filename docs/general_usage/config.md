# Configuration file

The configuration file is necessary to specify where the pipeline can find the input files that it needs for a proper execution. An example for a ready-to-use `config.yml` is presented during the [tutorial](../tutorial/tutorial_before.md/#before-running-the-pipeline) of the pipeline. Below is a table with currently implemented options, exemplary parameters, and a corresponding description for each field.  

| **Parameter**            | **Exemplary value**                                                                                      | **Description**                                                                                              |

If the insertion sequence contains reference genome parts, the matches here are needed to evaluate the true positive detections.                          |
| `splitmode`              | `Buffer`, `Split`, or `Join`                                                                                      | Mode used for processing reads based on the insertion: <ul><li><strong>Buffer:</strong> Replaces the insertion with "N" and retains the full length of each read. Recommended for the most accurate insertion location (CIGAR-based).</li><li><strong>Split:</strong> Cuts the insertion from the read and creates individual reads from the remaining sequence. The locations of the insertions are reported as the locations of each of the individual reads. Recommended for exploratory search for insertions that might fuse otherwise non-neighboring parts of the genome together.</li><li><strong>Join:</strong> Cuts the insertion from the read and joins the remaining sequence together. The locations of the insertions are reported as the location of the joined read. Recommended for debugging of otherwise unmappable reads.</li></ul> |

!!! info

    The parameter `blastn_db` is optional but recommended for the comparison of `insertion_fasta` to a healthy reference database. 

!!! note 
    Custom rules can be added to the config in the same way as the standard rules listed above. Their output, however, needs to be defined additionlly in the Snakefile.
